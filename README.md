# EchoFrame
The EchoFrame prototype is a framework for implementing and mediating dance scores in AR (AR scores). The AR scores can be understood as frames for movement exploration that enables embodying different movement concepts. These frames serve as a spatial documentation of the reflections behind an improvisation. 

The aim of EchoFrame was to design a tool for dance improvisation that enables the development of intuitive, spatial and dynamic dance scores. These scores can be continuously interpreted, re-enacted and explored by different bodies, in different contexts and at different times. 

The name, EchoFrame, is inspired by the the concept of an echo chamber and illustrates a conceptual space where movement exploration is repeated due to it being reflected in the frame. The scores in EchoFrame enables movement to persist even after the original exploration has ended.

EchoFrame is Primarily designed for hand-held devices and is developed using the **Three.js** library for creating 3D scenes and **WebXR** for AR rendering.

## EchoFrame Instructions


Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the AR functionalities in *EchoFrame* is handled by the *WebXR device API*, the following is required:

- An ARCore supported android device (https://developers.google.com/ar/devices#google_play_devices)
- Google Play Services for AR installed and enabled on the device
- Chrome 81+ installed on the device with XR flags enabled (chrome://flags/)
- A secure context (https://)

Some of the AR functionalitites might perform differently (e.g. depth sensing, real world understanding, 3D model rendering), depending on the device.

NOTE: WebXR is not compatible with iOS.

Instructions to run and access EchoFrame
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to run and access *EchoFrame*. (1) Through the website, where *EchoFrame* is hosted or (2) running the code on your device by cloning the GitHub repository.

(1) Website:
*EchoFrame* can be accessed from the Chrome browser on an Android phone by following this link: https://research-prototype.github.io/EchoFrame/.

(2) GitHub Repository:
If you want to run *EchoFrame* on your own device, follow the steps outlined below: 
NOTE: Node.js is required. 

1. Clone the github repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run "npm install" in the terminal, to install all dependencies and dev dependencies.
4. Run "npm run dev" in the terminal. This will start the following servers:
   - A local server running on your device, which can be accessed by following the "Local" link specified in the terminal. This is only accessible from the device running the server.
   - A network server running on your local network, which can be accessed by following the "Network" link specified in the terminal . This is accessible from any device on your local network. 

You will have to use the network server, accessing it from a Chrome browser on an android phone, to enter the AR experience. It is not possible to access AR functions on a computer, however, the scores implemented in *EchoFrame*, can still be seen without AR, showing it as a normal Three.js scene in the web browser. 

Instructions to experience EchoFrame
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you have accessed *EchoFrame*, either through the hosted website or cloning the repository and run it locally, you can experience the implemented AR scores, by following the steps outlined below:

1. From the landingpage, you can navigate to five different AR scores (Score 1, Score 2, Score 3, Score 4, Score 5).

2. Click on one of the AR scores to begin.

3. Start the AR experience by clicking the "Enter AR" button at the bottom of the screen. 

4. To exit the AR experience, click the cross in the top right corner. 

5. To return to the landingpage, refresh the page.
